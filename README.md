# (Work in progress) YAVE - Functional Reactive Visual Programming Language for Multimedia Processing

`Yave` is a research project to create dataflow visual programming language with functional reactive programming.   
This project is particularly focused on extending visual dataflow paradigm for multimedia, animation, and data visualization to support declarative time controls.

Some important properties of this language:

* Statically Typed  
  Node graph will be checked with type inference before execution.

* Functional  
  Supports functional operations like map on lists. 

* Reactive  
  Provides primitives for declarative time controls.


#### *This project is still work in progress.*  
*Most of stuff are still PoC stage and contains lots of obsolete stuff.*
